Lemur ???
----------
* Added @Documented annotation to StyleAttribute so that it shows up in the
    javadoc. (oops)
* Fixed bug in Panel where insets were not applied during setInsets() if
    an InsetsComponent had been previously set (or insets were set a second
    time).
* Fixed a bug with up/down event processing in Button.  It was possible to
    receive up events when no down event was received.  Now every down gets
    an up and there are no ups without downs.
* Added an additional constructor to Container that takes a layout and elementId.
* Added a simplified SpringGridLayout constructor that just takes the axes for
    axis ordering.
* Modified DefaultMouseListener to have more configurable click detection.
    A click threshold can be specified on the constructor instead of being hard-coded
    to three.  Also, the click detection is done with an easily overridable method.
* Fixed IconComponent to allow setting the alpha value even if a color has not been
    set.  Color defaults to white in that case.


Lemur v1.5.1
-------------
* Fixed an error message in SpringGridLayout to refer to itself properly.
* Modified GuiGlobals to have a protected getAssetManager() field.
* Fixed a bug in PickEventSession when using non-Viewport root pick roots.
* Added setters/getters for MouseAppState's includeDefaultNodes field that
    controls if pick roots are automatically added during initialize.
* Fixed Slider to not add the drag handler to the slider range.  It was a
    leftover from when drag events weren't delivered to the capture properly
    and now left the strange behavior of dragging in the slider range causing
    the button to move.
* Added Axis.getDirection() to return one of the constant Vector3f.UNIT_X,
    UNIT_Y, or UNIT_Z depending on the axis value.
* Added Slider.getValueForLocation() which can be used to calculate where
    in the model's range a particular local coordinate represents.  Useful
    for a variety of range-related listener behavior.
* Updated GuiControl.setPreferredSize() to throw an illegal argument exception
    if the specified size is negative.
* Fixed GuiControl.setSize() to not mutate the passed in size.
* GuiControl.setSize() passes the original size to GuiControl listeners instead
    of the child-mutated size.
* Fixed a small sizing issue in BorderLayout where it was always passing
    through 0 for the z size when setting the size of children.  Now it passes
    through the size that was passed to reshape.
* Added Button.removeClickCommands()
* Added Container.clearChildren()
* Modified PickEventSession to keep its pick roots in a SafeArrayList for
    garbage-free iteration.
* Added setAlpha()/getAlpha() to ColoredComponent and modified all ColoredComponent
    implementors to have the new methods.
* Added Panel.setAlpha() and Panel.getAlpha() for setting the alpha of just 
    the panel and it's components or of all children recursively.  Useful
    for fading in/out entire UI hierarchies.
* Fixed a bug in DefaultRangedValueModel where changes to min and max value weren't
    incrementing the version.        
* Added some more trace level logging to the Styles class to help users debug
    style issues.
* Added styling attributes for Panel.alpha and Panel.preferredSize
* Added vec3() and vec2() functions to the style API
* Fixed GuiControl to clamp the passed size to min 0,0,0 during reshape.
* Added a check for negative sizes to GuiControl.setSize().
* Refactored how named layer ordering is done in GuiControl by creating a separte
    ComponentStack class that can enforce a total ordering based on named layers.
    Soooo much simpler.  All of the other GUI elements were modified to use it.
    The breaking change is for any custom GUI element that relied on the old weird
    component ordering methods as they are now gone.
* Added setIcon() to label to set an icon-layer component.  (This was made easy
    by the above refactoring and is long overdue.)
* Breaking fix: modified how TextComponent's z offset is used to be more sensible
    and to properly affect the next layer in the stack.  This directly affects
    shadowOffset and any styling using shadowOffset probably needs the sign of
    its z component flipped.  The new default shadow offset is now (1, -1, -1)
* Added FocusChangeListener and FocusChangeEvent support.  GuiControl now has
    add/removeFocusChangeListener() methods for registering listeners that will
    be notified when the control loses or gains focus.
* Fixed a bug in SpringGridLayout where a minorFill wasn't getting handled 
    right if major file was set to ForcedEven and minorFill was not.
* Fixed a bug in CursorEvent deliver if the captured spatial was removed before
    the up event was received.  The attempt to deliver move events was throwing
    NPEs.  Now it just returns the current event consumption state instead.
* Panel now has a "border" property in addition to "background", so all 
    regular GUI elements can now have separate borders and backgrounds.
* GuiControl can now be "focusable" even if none of it's child components are
    by using the setFocusable() method.
* Added a Slider constructor that takes Axis, ElementId, and style.
* Gave TbtQuadBackgroundComponent a proper toString() method.
* Gave SpringGridLayout a proper toString() method.
* Added some style-less constructors for Label and Container.
* Modified IconComponent and QuadBackgroundComponent to set AlphaDiscardThreshold
    instead of just alphaTest since alphaTest is a no-op in JME 3.1.  (Note: this
    is a breaking change for 3.0 because it's Unshaded.j3md doesn't have an
    AlphaDiscardThreshold.)
* Styles.DEFAULT_STYLE changed to Styles.ROOT_STYLE to better reflect what it's
    for... also the constant was changed from "default" to "root".
* Styles now supports a user-defined default style that will be used for style
    application when no other style is defined.  Useful for globally setting
    a UI's look and feel.
* Modified some Styles trace logging to include more info.
* GuiGlobals font loading modified to set AlphaDiscardThreshold in addition to
    alphaTest since alphaTest is a no-op in JME 3.1.  (Note: this
    is a breaking change for 3.0 because it's Unshaded.j3md doesn't have an
    AlphaDiscardThreshold.)
* Added a TextField constructor that takes just text and element ID.
* Fixed a syntax error in StyleApi.groovy's vec2() helper function.     


Lemur 1466
-----------
* InsetsComponent constructor now calls setInsets() instead of setting the
    field directly.
* Updated the border.png image.
* Added icons that can be used for a glass-style checkbox on/off state.
    (preparing for someday including 'glass' style by default.)
* Added a GuiControlListener and abstract base implementation (names subject
    to change) for receiving GuiControl reshape and focus events.
* Fixed a bug in Slider where the thumb would get invalid positions when
    the slider was resized after initial display.
* Added another constructor to Checkbox that takes the string, model,
    element ID, and style.
* Added a better error message to the StyleLoader when groovy is not
    present.
* Added some trace logging to the Styles class.
* Added a TabbedPanel GUI element.
* Added a RollupPanel GUI element.
* Added a BaseStyles loader for loading built-in styles.
* Added a built-in "glass" style under resource com/simsilica/lemur/style/base/glass-styles.groovy
    Projects can define their own file under the same resource path if they
    want to extend or override parts of the glass style.
* Fixed an issue in button click handling where the click distance was too
    sensitive... in fact for buttons there should be no click distance at all
    as long as you are still over the button.  And that's how it behaves now.

------------
* Slider now consumes the MouseMotionEvent if dragging is in progress.  This
    fixes an issue with the spatial highlighting being turned off if the mouse
    or touch event slides off the spatial during dragging.
* Moved FocusTarget and FocusManagerState to a separate 'focus' package.
* Added isFocused() and isFocusable() to FocusTarget.
* Modified FocusManagerState to be hierarchy aware when it comes to notifying
    changes in focus.  This means that parent FocusTargets will also get
    notified.
* Fixed DynamicInsetsComponent to overcome a previous limitation where it
    wouldn't work if the containing GUI element already had its preferred
    size set.
* Added a utility method findFocusTarget() to FocusManagerState.  This is
    a refactoring of a previous protected method.
* Added a ProgressBar GUI element.            
    

Lemur r1375
------------
* TouchAppState fixed to avoid some minor per-update garbage
    creation.
* Refactored how Styles are kept internally.  This fixes some
    limitations that existed with parent/child selectors.
* LayerComparator's setLayer() utility methods were modified to
    treat layer 0 as null so the attribute gets removed.
* Added layer number support to TextComponent and modified
    Label to give text components layers that will be less
    likely to conflict with backgrounds (also text with shadows).
* Fixed a small event consumption bug in PickEventSession that
    only affected cases where MouseEventControl and CursorEventControl
    were used on a spatial together.
* Fixed the camel-casing on the FillMode enum.  This will break anyone
    using the old names but enums are hard to fix nicely and I feel
    it's better to bite the bullet now.
* Fixed the camel-casing on the HAlignment and VAlignment enums.  This
    will break anyone using the old names, see above for reasoning.
* Fixed the camel-casing on the InputState enum.  This will break anyone
    using the old names, see above for reasoning.
    Sorry for the trouble.



Lemur r1327
------------
* Updated Panel javadoc to clarify y-inversion in layouts.
* Added a ConsumingMouseListener implementation that can be
    used to make GUI elements "opaque" to mouse events.
* Added TextField.setFont().
* TextComponent and TextEntryComponent will no longer recreate
    the BitmapText in setFont() unless the font has actually
    changed.
* QuadBackgroundComponent modified to support Textures.
* Added a HoverMouseListener to better facility fly-over style
    tool tips.
* Added the ElementId to the toString() of the core GUI elements.
* MouseAppState modified to do picking on the collision roots in
    reverse order so that they better act like layers.
* Added convenience methods to ElementId to grab a child element
    ID using the dot-notation preferred by the style system.
* Added standard get() method to Attributes that looks up the
    value without doing a default value check (which requires knowing
    the type).
* Add the ability to retrieve the command lists from a button.
* Added a double-gradient.png standard icon for creating 'glass-like'
    vertical bevels.
* Added a protected getDragStartLocation() to the default DragHandler
    implementation so that subclasses can retrieve it if needed.  Useful
    for implementations that will indicate "rubber-banding" or similar.
* Added a PickEventSession to handle delivery of cursor-based events
    to pickable components.  Useful for non-mouse based event handling
    (ie: joysticks, touch, etc.) or when event locations need to be
    rempapped during event processing.
* Changed MouseAppState to use a PickEventSession for its picking and
    event delivery.
* Added Cursor-related events, listeners, and a CursorEventControl that
    works similarly to MouseEventControl but provides information about
    the collision.
* Converted Slider and DragHandler to use the new cursor events so that
    they could better calculate projection.
* Optimized QuadBackgroundComponent to avoid resizing the quad if its
    size hasn't changed.
* Added getChildren() and clearChildren() to GuiLayout and its
    implementations.
* Fixed SpringGridLayout.remove() to recalculate the row and column
    counts.
* Exposed button states isPressed() and isHighlightOn().
* Added a method to SpringGridLayout to get the node at a specific
    row and column.
* Modified SpringGridLayout to allow null children.  This can be useful
    for padding out the edges for FillMode.FORCED_EVEN
* Fixed SpringGridLayout to report the proper preferred size when
    FillMode.FORCED_EVEN is used for an axis.
* Updated the javadoc for MouseAppState and PickEventSession
* Added a TouchAppState for handling touch events similar to
    how mouse events are handled but supporting multi-touch.
* GuiGlobals updated to automatically include touch support if
    detected.  (Currently if touch is detected then the mouse
    support is disabled.)
* Updated DragHandler to be a CursorEventListener instead of a
    MouseEventListener.  This means it can avoid using the deprecated
    back door methods to getting ViewPort info since it is now part
    of the cursor event itself.
* Fixed SpringGridLayout to do better clean-up if replacing an
    existing node at a specific row, column.
* Added collection based addCommands() to CommandMap
* Added a (style IDed) setter to Button for setting the whole
    command map.
* Added some ElementId-based getSelector() methods to the Styles API.
* Redid how the nested elements of a Slider are IDed.  The class constants
    now refer to the nested part and not the whole ID.  This means that
    if the user sets their own ElementId for the slider that the children
    will match.
    (Breaking change: for style code expecting the old element IDs.)
* Added an aditional full-parameter constructor to Slider.
* Fixed DefaultRangedValueModel to reclamp the value if the range changes.
* QuadBackgroundComponent and TbtQuadBackgroundComponent manage their
    internal material better and now expose the GuiMaterial to callers.
* Mouse button events now force a mouse move event just in case the button
    event comes sooner than the latest pick info.
* Added a removeListenersFromSpatial() method to MouseEventControl (and
    CursorEventControl) that acts just like the addListenersToSpatial()
    in that it will ignore spatials without the MouseEventControl.
* Perform null checks in addListenersToSpatial() and removeListenersFromSpatial().
